# PacViewer
 Advanced tool for viewing and editing Patapon PAC files.
 
 To make it work properly after compilation, place all files from /res/ folder to the place of compiled .exe file. /res/ folder contains the necessary instruction set for the tool and guide on how to write your own instructions to the set. (+ a font file to make it show text)
